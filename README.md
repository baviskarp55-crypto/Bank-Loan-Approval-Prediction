# Bank-Loan-Approval-Prediction
This project predicts whether a bank should approve a loan using Logistic Regression. It focuses on a clean workflow, clear logic, and practical evaluation rather than just accuracy. Using customer financial and employment details, the model classifies loan applications as Approved (1) or Not Approved (0).
